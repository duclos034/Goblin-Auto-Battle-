What to develop for an auto battle

Need to give stats to each character
    - Followed up with buff items and design synergies
    - Add more monsters and abilities
    - Establish an extra phase to check for status affects and then apply the status's affect
    
Make basic GUI
    - Make it to where you can drag the characters onto a battle plain
    - Need to make a basic start menu

Set up a game loop:

    - For later designs, make a whole list of monsters but randomly show a few at a time but for now just display all available monsters
    - Make it so the monsters are random for team 2
    - Add "player health" to prepare for the eventual change to the gameloop
    - Tweak the order of operation to where a team is set up each round


Small log of extra ideas
    2. Battle Animation or Visual Effects
    Animate attacks, damage, and defeats using CSS or images.
    Show health bars that update in real time.
    3. Player vs. Player (PvP) or Player vs. AI Team Selection
    Let the user build both teams, or randomize both.
    Add a “Rematch” or “New Battle” button.
    4. Battle Log Improvements
    Add timestamps or turn numbers to each log entry.
    Allow scrolling through the full battle history.
    5. Balance and Stats
    Add stats like speed, defense, or critical hit chance.
    Balance fighters so battles are more interesting.
    6. Sound and Music
    Add background music or different sounds for abilities and attacks.
    7. Save and Load Teams
    Let users save multiple teams and load them for future battles.
    Let me know which idea you like, or if you want code for any of these features!
